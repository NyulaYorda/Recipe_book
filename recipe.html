<h1>Waakye Recipe</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>5 ½ cups white rice</li>
    <li>2 cups black eye peas</li>
    <li>10-12 pieces of millet or waakye leaves</li>
    <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>5-7 cups water</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Wash the beans and soak them overnight in enough water to cover them by 2 inches. If you are pressed for time, soak for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>The next day, drain the beans and transfer them to a large pot. Add the millet or waakye leaves, baking soda, and 3 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the beans are tender.</li>
    <li>Add the rice to the pot and stir to combine. Add 3 cups of water and salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through.</li>
    <li>Take out the waakye leaves and fluff the rice with a fork. Cover the pot and let it sit for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Serve the waakye hot with your favorite stew, fried fish, or other side dishes.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
    <li>If you prefer your waakye very soft, add more water, about ½ - 1 cup.</li>
    <li>You can also cook the beans and rice in a pressure cooker. This will save time and make the dish more flavorful.</li>
    <li>To make a tomato stew, heat some oil in a pot over medium heat. Add some chopped onions and cook until softened. Add some chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, and your favorite spices. Cook until the stew is thickened.</li>
</ul>
